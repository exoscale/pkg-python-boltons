Description: set of pure-Python utilities (Python 2)
 Boltons is a set of over 160 BSD-licensed, pure-Python utilities in the same
 spirit as — and yet conspicuously missing from — the standard library,
 including:
 .
  - Atomic file saving, bolted on with fileutils
  - A highly-optimized OrderedMultiDict, in dictutils
  - Two types of PriorityQueue, in queueutils
  - Chunked and windowed iteration, in iterutils
  - Recursive data structure iteration and merging, with iterutils.remap
  - Exponential backoff functionality, including jitter, through
    iterutils.backoff
  - A full-featured TracebackInfo type, for representing stack traces, in
    tbutils
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2.
